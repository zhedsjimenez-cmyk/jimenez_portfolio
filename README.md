# Reflection
    Creating this portfolio was both a rewarding and challenging experience. One of the main challenges I faced was designing a layout that felt both professional and unique to my personal brand. Initially, I struggled with choosing the right colors, fonts, and structure that would reflect my personality while remaining accessible and responsive. To solve this, I researched design inspirations, experimented in Figma, and iterated based on feedback from peers.

    Another challenge was responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility. While the desktop layout looked polished, I had to troubleshoot several layout shifts on mobile devices. I resolved these issues using CSS media queries and tools like Chrome DevTools for testing on various screen sizes.
Deploying the site was also a learning experience. I encountered issues with assets not loading correctly after deployment due to incorrect relative paths. I fixed this by reorganizing the file structure and testing the build process locally before pushing to production.

    If I were to improve the portfolio next, I would add a blog section to share my learning journey and technical articles. I'd also integrate animations for smoother transitions and explore adding accessibility features like keyboard navigation and ARIA labels. Additionally, I'd like to connect a contact form to a backend service like Formspree or Firebase to make it fully functional.
    Overall, the process taught me a lot about the intersection of design and development, and I'm excited to continue building on this foundation.
